(Switch-Case Statement) 

switch EXPR:
    case EXPR:
        SUITE

        SUITE
    ...
    else:
        SUITE


**Status**:
Still unclear on what we are required to do so we have not started yet. We are unclear on whether we are in groups just to peer review and writing on different topics or whether we are in groups to write about the same topic but in separate papers. By 4:50 on Wednesday, we had not found a third partner.
